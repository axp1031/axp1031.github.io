    "text": "My Response to Moving to a World Beyond “p &lt; 0.05”\n\n\n\n\n\nThis editorial allowed me to reflect on the strong push within the statistical community to move beyond the simplistic and often misleading reliance on the p-value threshold of 0.05 for determining “statistical significance” in scientific research. The editorial, introducing a special issue of The American Statistician, argues that the term “statistically significant” should be abandoned entirely because it has become meaningless and contributes to erroneous beliefs and poor decision-making.\nInstead of focusing solely on whether a p-value falls below an arbitrary threshold, the authors advocate for a more nuanced approach to statistical inference that emphasizes accepting uncertainty as inherent in research and embracing variation in effects. It also highlights the importance of being thoughtful in all aspects of research, from clearly defining objectives and considering multiple analysis techniques to understanding the scientific context and the practical importance of effect sizes. He advocates for being open through transparent reporting of all findings (regardless of p-values), sharing data and code, and recognizing the role of expert judgment, as well as being modest by acknowledging the limitations of statistical models and inferences, understanding that one study is rarely definitive, and encouraging replication.\nThe editorial highlights that this is not just about what not to do with p-values, but also about adopting many constructive “do’s.” These suggestions range from supplementing p-values with measures like s-values and second-generation p-values (SGPVs) to using analysis of credibility (AnCred) and focusing on false positive risk (FPR). Many authors emphasize reporting continuous p-values, effect sizes, and interval estimates, interpreted as compatibility intervals, rather than relying on dichotomous “significant” or “non-significant” labels.\nUltimately, my takeaway is a call for a fundamental shift towards “statistical thinking” over a mechanical application of p-value thresholds, where researchers communicate all their findings with their inherent uncertainty and are judged on the quality and effective communication of their science, not solely on their p-values. This transition requires institutional changes in how research is conducted, reported, reviewed, and taught. The editorial frames this as a necessary and potentially transformative move towards more reliable and reproducible science."
