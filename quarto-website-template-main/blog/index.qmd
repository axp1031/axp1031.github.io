##             My Response to [*Moving to a World Beyond “p \< 0.05”*](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/toc/utas20/73/sup1)

This editorial allowed me to reflect on the strong push within the statistical community to move beyond the simplistic and often misleading reliance on the p-value threshold of 0.05 for determining "statistical significance" in scientific research. The editorial, introducing a special issue of *The American Statistician*, argues that the term "statistically significant" should be abandoned entirely because it has become meaningless and contributes to erroneous beliefs and poor decision-making.

Instead of focusing solely on whether a p-value falls below an arbitrary threshold, the authors advocate for a more nuanced approach to statistical inference that emphasizes **accepting uncertainty** as inherent in research and embracing variation in effects. It also highlights the importance of being **thoughtful** in all aspects of research, from clearly defining objectives and considering multiple analysis techniques to understanding the scientific context and the practical importance of effect sizes. He advocates for **being open** through transparent reporting of all findings (regardless of p-values), sharing data and code, and recognizing the role of expert judgment, as well as **being modest** by acknowledging the limitations of statistical models and inferences, understanding that one study is rarely definitive, and encouraging replication.

The editorial highlights that this is not just about what *not* to do with p-values, but also about adopting many constructive "do's." These suggestions range from supplementing p-values with measures like s-values and second-generation p-values (SGPVs) to using analysis of credibility (AnCred) and focusing on false positive risk (FPR). Many authors emphasize reporting continuous p-values, effect sizes, and interval estimates, interpreted as compatibility intervals, rather than relying on dichotomous "significant" or "non-significant" labels.

Ultimately, my takeaway is a call for a **fundamental shift towards "statistical thinking" over a mechanical application of p-value thresholds**, where researchers communicate all their findings with their inherent uncertainty and are judged on the quality and effective communication of their science, not solely on their p-values. This transition requires institutional changes in how research is conducted, reported, reviewed, and taught. The editorial frames this as a necessary and potentially transformative move towards more reliable and reproducible science.
