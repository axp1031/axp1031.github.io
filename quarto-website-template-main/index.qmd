# **Welcome to my website!**

I am Arya Patel, a student at Case Western Reserve University pursuing a BA in Biology and MPH with a concentration in population health research. I have had past research experience in laboratory work in improving Car-T cell therapy for lymphoma and applying it to solid tumors and bioinformatic studies using bacteriophage genomes. My current research interests include oncologic surgery outcomes and health disparities using big data.

On this website, you will find a selection of my research experiences and works. You will also find my CV.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:axp1031@case.edu) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
