    "text": "My Response to “How to Be a Modern Scientist” by Jeff Leek\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most important takeaways from reading “How to Be A Modern Scientist” by Jeffrey Leek is the critical importance of open science practices, particularly the sharing of data and code.\nLeek emphasizes that making research materials easily accessible, reusable, and checkable is a fundamental cornerstone of the modern scientific process. He argues that researchers should include links to data, code, and software prominently in their publications and provides practical advice on utilizing public repositories like arXiv, bioRxiv, Figshare, Github, and field-specific databases. The rationale behind this push for open science is to dramatically increase the use and impact of one’s work, to foster reproducibility, and to enable others to build upon existing research.\nThis emphasis on open science has proven to be relevant even a decade after the book’s publication. The benefits Leek outlined, such as increased visibility and the potential for others to verify and build upon research, have become increasingly apparent in the years since the book was written.\nThe concept of the “unoriginal genius,” which Leek discusses as a trend in literature and observes emerging in science, further emphasizes the significance of open science. The modern scientist increasingly combines existing ideas and tools to address new problems, a process that inherently relies on the accessibility and transparency of prior work, including data and code.\nLeek also acknowledges the potential challenges and concerns associated with data sharing, such as the need for proper credit for data generators and the initial reluctance to make data publicly available. However, he firmly advocates for the practice as a core component of modern scientific conduct. He even provides guidance on how to format data effectively for sharing, including providing raw data, a tidy data set, a code book, and an exact recipe for data processing.\nJeffrey Leek’s “How to Be A Modern Scientist” conveys the essential role of open science, particularly the sharing of data and code in order to improve the impact, reproducibility, and collaborative nature of modern scientific research. This lesson remains a cornerstone of effective and responsible scientific practice."
